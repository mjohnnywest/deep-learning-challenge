This is a project uses tensorflow to create a deep learning model to predict success in ventures

## Features

- Drops data columns that aren't targets or features
- Uses getdummies to convert categorical columns into booleans to make the columns easier to read for the model
- Compiles, trains and evaluates models to see how well it predictied ventures

## Requirements

- sklearn

- tensorflow


## Usage

Ensure all required libaries are pip installed
